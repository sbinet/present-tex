* A chapter

* A title

[[https://github.com/sbinet/present-tex][present-tex]] converts a `.slide` presentation to a `LaTeX/Beamer` presentation.

Here are some bullets:

- correctly rendered
- but not numbered

* `present-tex` and `code`

Consider this simple package `github.com/me/hello`:

.code _code/hello.go

* `present-tex` and `play`

`present-tex` has some limited supported for `.play`:

.play _code/hello.go

* `.code` support

`present-tex` infers the language of a `.code` snippet based on the file extension.

Here is some `C`:

.code _code/hello.c

And here is some `python`:

.code _code/hello.py

* `present-tex` and images

Images are supported, such as this lovely `PNG` gopher:

.image _figs/gopher.png
.caption _Gopher_ by [[http://www.reneefrench.com][Renée French]]

* `present-tex` and images (cont'd)

or that lovely gopher:

.image _figs/gopher.png 300 245
.caption _Gopher_ by [[http://www.reneefrench.com][Renée French]]

* `present-tex` and text formatting

`present-tex` should be able to correctly handle URLs like [[https://github.com/sbinet/present-tex][so]].

But, also, *bold* text and text in _italics_.
It should correctly handle `foo_bar`.

Special `LaTeX` characters, such as &{}\$%^_#, are also correctly handled.

.link https://github.com/sbinet/present-tex

Snippets of code look like so:

 $> ls /my/dir
 $> exit

[[https://github.com/sbinet/present-tex]] is still a _work_in_progress_.
