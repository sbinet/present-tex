## A chapter

## A title

[present-tex](https://github.com/sbinet/present-tex) converts a `.slide` presentation to a `LaTeX/Beamer` presentation.

Here are some bullets:

  - correctly rendered
  - but not numbered

## `present-tex` and `code`

Consider this simple package `github.com/me/hello`:

.code _code/hello.go

## `present-tex` and `play`

`present-tex` has some limited supported for `.play`:

.play _code/hello.go

## `.code` support

`present-tex` infers the language of a `.code` snippet based on the file extension.

Here is some `C`:

.code _code/hello.c

And here is some `python`:

.code _code/hello.py

## `present-tex` and images

Images are supported, such as this lovely `PNG` gopher:

.image _figs/gopher.png
.caption _Gopher_ by [[http://www.reneefrench.com][RenÃ©e French]]

## `present-tex` and images (cont'd)

or that lovely gopher:

.image _figs/gopher.png 300 245

## `present-tex` and images (cont'd)

Now using `CommonMark` syntax:

![gopher](_figs/gopher.png)

## `present-tex` and text formatting

`present-tex` should be able to correctly handle URLs like [so](https://github.com/sbinet/present-tex).

But, also, **bold** text and text in _italics_.

Special `LaTeX` characters, such as &{}\$%^_#, are also correctly handled.

.link https://github.com/sbinet/present-tex

Snippets of code look like so:

	$> ls /my/dir
	$> exit

[github.com/sbinet/present-tex](https://github.com/sbinet/present-tex) is still a _work in progress_.

**The END.**
